# Basic idea
The idea was to build a performant cellular automaton simulating basic elemental interactions based in C++.

# Controls
`q` quits the game
`p` pauses the game
### Delay
The game can be slowed down with `+` (add delay) and sped up with `-` (remove delay)

### Drawing
By holding `Left Click` you can draw the selected material
By pressing `Right Click` in two corners you can create a square in the marked area made of the selected material

By pressing certain numbers you can switch between materials. The materials are the following: <br/>
`0`: Air / Delete <br/>
`1`: Wood (Flammable) <br/>
`2`: Water (Flows) <br/>
`3`: Sand (Gravity effected) <br/>
`4`: Stone <br/>
